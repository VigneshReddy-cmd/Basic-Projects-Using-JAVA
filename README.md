The Tetris game provides an excellent platform to showcase data structures and algorithms (DSA) skills while honing problem-solving abilities. In this implementation, various DSA concepts are utilized:

Array of Tetraminos: The Tetris pieces are represented using a 3D array, showcasing the use of arrays to manage game elements efficiently.

Piece Rotation: Algorithms are employed to rotate Tetris pieces, ensuring they fit correctly within the game grid without overlapping or going out of bounds.

Collision Detection: DSA is used to detect collisions between Tetris pieces and the well, preventing pieces from overlapping or going beyond the boundaries of the game board.
